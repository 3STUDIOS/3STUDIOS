            <h2>destiny stream changes</h2>
            <p>After last weeks stream (a bloody 'weasel' disaster that was), i have decided to do a weekly stream so my schedule can match up better with <a href="#">dalore</a> or other members of burn esports.</p>
            <h2>weekly destiny stream</h2>
            <p>I'd better get myself some watter because this game is dry as fuck. So i'll be (trying to) stream destiny every friday. first stream is on 10/03/17 at 8-9pm GMT+1.</p>
            <h2>50 subscribers</h2>
            <p>I would like to thank each and every single one of you. i will be doing a '50 subscriber special' soon.</p>
